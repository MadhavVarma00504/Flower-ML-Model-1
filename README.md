Iris Classification Using SVM
This is a simple project to classify Iris flowers using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in Python.

Overview
We use the Iris dataset, which contains data on three types of Iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

The model uses four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width


Results
After training, the model will give an accuracy score for how well it classifies the flowers.
